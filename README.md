# blog-rest-api

This full-stack app consists of two separate web apps. Each has its own frontend built with SvelteKit. Both apps share an Express backend which communicates with a postgreSQL database. One SvelteKit app allows an author of a blog to log in and manage blog posts. The other allows readers to log in, view published posts, and leave comments on them.
